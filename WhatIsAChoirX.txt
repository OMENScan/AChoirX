AChoirX - v10.01.61 - Release 1.61

AChoirX
=======
AChoirX (Achoir 10) - Is the next evolution in the ideas that originally motivated me to 
write the original AChoir Live Response / Forensic Collection / Extraction / Parsing / Analysis
tool. My original goals were to create a flexible scripting language for gathering Windows 
forensic artifacts locally or remotely, in both a Live Response situation as well as a 
more traditional mounted forensic disk image situation.

AChoirX is a port of AChoir (written in C) to Go(lang).  The port to Go is for one purpose:
To create a single unufied forensic collection and extraction tool that can be used for 
Windows, Linux, and OSX.


Why AChoirX:
============
Every Incident Responder eventually comes to the conclusion that they need to script their 
favorite Live Acquisition utilities and commands.  For some reason (or many reasons) many 
of those scripts are often shared only among trusted parties.

I have seen these scripts written in numerous scripting languages - but oddly enough, all of 
these scripts tend to use many of the same freely available utilities and commands - To do 
mostly the same things.

It often takes a Responder several years, along with lots of trial and error to settle on a 
set of utilities (and options) that both work, and that provide relevant information on useful 
forensic artifacts.

And even though Responders often use the same utilities and are scripting them in largely 
the same way, each Responder has to go through the same pain of building their own script in 
their (not so) favorite scripting language - figuring out how to quickly and consistently 
gather the artifacts of most value and limit the scripting footprint. 

I believe that this process of re-inventing the wheel over and over again is just silly. 

That's why I originally wrote AChoir.



So How is AChoirX different?
============================
AChoirX has several goals:

1. Provide a consistent, single, and unified forensic tool for all three major OSs: Windows, Linux, OSX
2. Identify the best free single-purpose forensic utilities and script them
3. Identify the most valuable platform specific commands and utilities and script them
4. Make it easy to get these utilities, and automate the building of Collection/Extraction toolkits
5. Self Document
6. Build a Framework for Live Response collection, and mounted image processing Scripts/Toolkits
7. Make remote acquisition as easy as local acquisition

AchoirX itself is architected with two primary functional concepts:

1. To download the Acquisition utilities and organize them into a Acquisition Toolkit
2. To run those utilities and commands (Toolkit) in an organized way.


An AChoirX script can download, and unzip these utilities in order to create a Live 
Acquisition Toolkit.  We have provided our version of a "Build" script for Windows, but you can 
create your own.

The idea is to make it easily repeatable to download and organize these utilities. That 
is: with just AChoirX and a builder script, anyone can build an Acquisition Scripting Toolkit.

This has the additional benefit of documenting where everything came from.

The second functional concept of running the Acquisition Script to gather artifacts is 
obvious.  But what AChoirX tries to do is make that experience consistent and repeatable - 
even across platforms.

AchoirX creates unique directories for every Acquisition run, and has built in functions 
like hashing and platform detection.  In this way we are creating both a consistent 
framework and a scripting language that is targeted specifically at Live Acquisition (but
can also be used on mounted images for extracting, parsing and analyzing artifacts).


So Isn't This Just another Scripting Language?  I can do that already.
======================================================================
I would say, you could do everything AChoirX does with almost any scripting language - If 
that is what you want to do.  In fact, that is how AChoirX started life.  But Achoir's goals 
are to make Live Acquisition scripting consistent - even across platforms, and to make the 
whole process easier for Responders.

We are also very sensitive to the "Observer Effect" problem when Acquiring artifacts, and 
AchoirX will continue to be coded in a way to minimize disturbing the artifacts.  This takes 
some work when writing your own Live Acquisition scripting programs, using multiple languages
across multiple platforms.



OK. I'm Sold.  How does it work?
================================
The AchoirX scripting language has two primary concepts:

1. Objects
2. Actions


Actions are the thing you want to do.  Objects are the thing(s) you want to do the Actions 
against.  Actions always start in column 1, they are three letters folowed by a colon(:).

  Note:As of AChoir v0.99 Actions can be indented using tabs or spaces.

Objects Can go anywhere and start with an ampersand(&) followed by three letters.


Here is a simple example:
Dir:\Test
Say:The Current Directory is: &Dir


In this example, a lot of things are going on.  First the &Dir object is being set by the DIR: 
action.  In addition, if that directory does not exist it will be created.  All directories are 
created RELATIVE to the directory AchoirX was run from. doing this ensures consistency every 
time AchoirX is run, and prevents one set of artifacts from stepping on another set.

The next statement (SAY:) then prints the text and &Dir object to both the screen, and a unique 
LogFile (and Syslog if it set) for each run. 


Here is another Example:

ACQ:\Reg
CPY:"C:\Users\**\NTUSER.DAT" "&Acq"


In this example our goal is to Copy all User NTUSER.DAT Registry files under the C:\USERS Directory
and all subdirectories.  We want to do this using AChoir's built-in Copy Action. In the example 
above we are using the Double-Star to tell AchoirX to search all subdirectories.  If we only wanted 
to copy the files located under C:\Users we would use a single Star: C:\Users\*\NTUSER.DAT.  This is a new feature 
with AChoirX and allows more control of whether a single directory will be searched (*) or all 
subdirectories will be searched (**).

First we set the Acquisition Sub-Directory (ACQ:) object (&Acq) to "\Reg"  This is a path directly 
under the unique generated Acquisition Directory.

Next, the CPY: action copies any/all NTUSER.DAT files found in any subdirectory under C:\Users 
(Note: wildcards are also valid) into the &Acq directory.



Actions:
========
AChoirX uses most of the original Actions that AChoir uses.  However, some Actions have been 
removed and some have been added.  Here is the current list of all the AChoirX Actions and Objects:

SET:SFTPServ=<SFTPServer> SFTP Server To Upload Artifact
SET:S3Region=<AWS Region> The region that the AWS S3 Bucket is in
SET:S3Bucket=<AWS Bucket> The AWS Bucket Name
SET:S3AWSId=<AWS ID> The AWS ID
SET:S3AWSKey=<AWS Key> The AWS Secret Key
SET:SyslogT=<UDP | TCP> Sets the Syslog Protocol Type.
SET:SyslogL=<syslogging Level> Sets the Syslog Level.
                Options are: none, min, max
                The default is NONE (No Syslogging)
SET:SyslogP=<syslog Server Port> Sets the Syslog Server Port
SET:SyslogS=<syslog Server IP> Sets the Syslog Server
                IP Address, and sets the Syslog Level to 1
                Syslogging will immediately begin.
SET:CopyPath=None Set the CPY: Copy Path to None.
                  This will ignore the paths of the source files
                  and copy everything into the directory destination.
SET:CopyPath=Full Set the CPY: Copy Path to Full.
                  This will append the source file's copy path
                  to the output directory.  This allows the examiner
                  to quickly see exactly where the source file came from
SET:CopyPath=Part Set the CPY: Copy Path to Partial.
                  This will copy ONLY the path after the first wildcards.
                  This allows the examiner to see the RELATIVE path the 
                  the source files were found in.
SET:ParseQuote=<Strict> or <Lazy> - Determines if the &For and &Lst parser
                  enforces proper quote placement in CSV Files.
                  "Strict" enforces matching Quotes. "Lazy" Allows Unmatched
                  quotes or quotes not on CSV Delimiter boundaries. 
SET:DELIMS=<chars> These are the delimiters that the &FOR and &LST objects 
                   will use to Parse out &FO0-&FO9 and &LS0-&LS9
SET:ZipFileName=<FileName> Name of the Zip File to Write To
SET:ZipFileName=close Close the Current Zip File & assign new Zip File Name
SET:ZipFileRoot=<ZipRoot> Name of the Zip File Root in the Zip File
SET:CPUThrottle=<None>, <Low>, <Med,> <High> - Throttle AChoirX on CPU 
         Utilization (None, 25%, 50%, 75%)
SET:FILTER=<incl> <excl> <full> <part> - Set the filtering behavior
           incl = &FOR or &LST match entries in Filter File 
           excl = &FOR or &LST does NOT match entries in Filter File 
           full = &FOR or &LST Exact match with entries in Filter File 
           part = &FOR or &LST Partial match with entries in Filter File 
           regx = &FOR or &LST Use Regex entries in Filter File 
SAY:     Echo Text and Objects to the Screen and Logfile
CON:Hide Hide The Console Screen - For quiet Acquisition
         DO NOT USE IF YOU HAVE SCREEN INPUT - For any 
         Input be sure to Show any Hidden Screen
CON:Show Show a Previously Hidden Console
         Be Sure to Show any hidden screens before needed 
         Input.
CON:Last Show the last 10 Console Messaages.  This can be very useful
         When using AChoirX Server mode to re-display console messages
         that have scrolled off the screen.
CON:MSGLevel=<min>, <std>, <max>, <debug> Set console messages level.
         Levels break down (generally) as follows:
          min=Just display the command, progress and critical errors
           but no output
          std=Display the command, progress, critical errors, 
           and standard output
          max=Display the command, progress, critical errors, warnings,
           standard and extended output

         Set the &CN0 - &CN9 variables
         Increment/Decrement with CNx:++ and CNx:-- 
HSH:ACQ  Hash everything in the &ACQ directory and subdirectories
HSH:Dir  Hash everything in the &DIR directory and subdirectories
HSH:<FileName> MD5 Hash The file and store it in &HSH
FOR:     Set the &FOR object.  This is a Looping object based on 
         Files - For instance "FOR:C:\Users\*.DAT" will define
         All *.DAT Files under C:\Users. In this way a single 
         command can be run iteratively against all of these files. 
DSK:<typ>Set the &DSK object.  This is a Looping object based on 
         all attached/mounted disks that match the <typ>
         <typ> can be: Fixed, Remote, Remove, CDRom, RamDisk 
LST:<FileName>
         Set the &LST object.  This is a Looping object based on 
         Lines in the <FilName>. In this way a single command can
         be run iteratively replacing the &For variable with each
         entry in the <FileName>. 
FLT:<filename> or NONE
         Set the Filter File Name - This file contains text entries 
         to FILTER both the &FOR and &LST objects.  Setting the file
         name is not enough to filter, the SET:FILTER= options MUST
         also be set.  The NONE option removes the filter.
         Warning: The FILTER IS USED FOR BOTH &LST and &FOR.  Set 
         FLT:NONE when the filter is no longer needed to avoid unwanted
         filtering.
REG:<RegistryKey>
         Natively extract a Registry Key and ALL Sub-Keys under
         it.  The Key MUST BEGIN WITH ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:
          HKLM, HKCR, HKCU, HKUS, HKCC
         Example:
          REG:REG:HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
         REG: Only works for Windows Collections, and is disabled
         For Linux and OSX.
         The REgistry Extraction Output will be written to the 
         Current Active ACQ: directory under a file named:
          <RegistryKey>.csv
         The output is TAB Separated to make it more stable than CSV
CPY:     Copy Files (CPY:<FromFile> <ToFile>) - Supports Quotes
         Supports Wildcard. Important Note: CPY: WILL RECURSE THROuGH
         SUBDIRECTORIES ONLY IF A WILDCARD IS USED.
CPS:     Copy Files (CPS:<FromFile> <ToFile>) by Signature (Magic, Regex, or Hash)
         (Loaded by the Sig: Rex: or Hst: commands)
         Sig: Supports Wildcard. 
         Important Note: CPY: WILL RECURSE THROUGH SUBDIRECTORIES 
                         ONLY IF A WILDCARD IS USED.
         Important Note: ANY match on Magic OR Regex OR Hash will 
                         cause the Copy to happen.
NCP:     RAW NTFS Copy Files (NCP:<FromFile> <ToFile>) - Supports Quotes
         Supports Wildcard. Important Note: CPY: WILL RECURSE THROuGH
         SUBDIRECTORIES ONLY IF A WILDCARD IS USED.
         NCP: function similar to CPY but uses Raw Copy to copy locked
         and invisible files like $MFT, and Registry Hives - Implemented
         ONLY on Windows.
DEL:<File To Delete> - Delete Files (Accepts WildCards)
         Only Files in Subdirectories (Off of The AChoirX Root) can be 
         deleted. This is to prevent accidental Deletion of files not 
         related to the acquisition or toolkit
CLN:<AChoirX Sub-Directory to Clean and Delete>
         Cleans and Deletes all files and Subdirectories in the specified
         subdirectory (Off of The AChoirX Root). Only Files/Subdirectories
         Off of The AChoirX Root) can be deleted. This is to prevent 
         accidental Deletion of files not related to the acquisition or toolkit

/GXR:<URL> - Gets a Zip File, Extracts it, and runs the script.  This can be 
             used to download and run The Toolkit from a central URL
/INI:Console - Run In Interactive Mode (Console Input)
/INI:<File Name>  - Run the <File Name> script instead of AChoir.ACQ
        This Option WILL NOT Create a Base Acquisition Directory
        Use the ACQ: action to create the Base Acquisition Directory if you want one. 
/XTR    Extracts the embedded toolkit.
/PWD:<password> - Sets the &PWD variable
/DEC:<FileName> - Decrypts a file and writes it to: Decrypted.Dat
/DRV:<x:> - Set the &DRV parameter
        This option is designed to allow you to build dead-box scripts,
        and specify a drive variable (the drive letter that has been mounted).
/VR0: - /VR9:  
      Set the &VR0 - &VR9 variables from the command line.  These can be used 
      to pass variables to the AChoirX Scripts.
/DBG:<min>, <std>, <max>, <debug> - Set inital Console Output Message Level
/B64:<Base64SEncodedIniFileOfAChoirCommands> - Allows a Base64 Encoded string 
     to create an Ini File - work like the PowerShell -enc Parameter 
     Note: By Default the embeded toolkit will be unzipped.  If you do not want this
           specify the decoded ini file name (/INI:AChoirB64.ACQ) and AChoirX will
           not unembed the default tool kit - This is by design.
/CLI:<IP Address>:<Port> - This option tells AChoirX to run as a TCP Client by 
     connecting to the AChoirx Server.  This allows Remote control of the Client
     by the AChoirX Multi-Handler Server.  Any Number of Clients can connect to 
     The ChoirX Multi-Handler Server
/SRV:<IP Address>:<Port> - This option tells AChoirX to run as a TCP Server by 
     listening on the IP Address and Port Specified. This is a Multi-Handler
     server allowing multiple AChoirX Client connections. 


A note about AChoirX Client/Server Modes (Beta 0.01)
(/CLI: and /SRV:)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
AChoirX can be started as a TCP Client or Server.  This is done by the 
/CLI: or /SRV: command line parameters.  As a Client AChoirX is run as 
a remote shell, accepting commands from the server.  As a Server AChoirX
funtions as a Multi-Handler allowing control of several Clients.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Authentication and communication REQUIRES a shared
password.  This is done by specifying the password for both the Client
and Server at startup, For Example:

Client - /PWD:Pa$$word /CLI:192.168.1.101:5555
Server - /PWD:Pa$$word /SRV:0.0.0.0:5555

Note: It is important that the /PWD: option is specified FIRST, otherwise the
DEFAULT password (none) will be used.

All communications betweem the Client and Server are encrypted using this 
shared password, so without it on both Client and Server, AChoirX will not be 
able to communicate, and will fail.

The AChoirX Server Mode has only a few specific commands:
SESS:List - List the connected Client Sessions
SESS:n - Set the current Session to n
SESS:None - Set the current Session to NONE
KILL: - Shut Down the Multi Handler

You can also issue ANY AChoirX command to the Remote Session.  This functions
like the Local Console mode across TCP - however you will not see the output of
each command - Only the standard AChoirX console messages will be seen.

To force the remote Session to end, use the standard AChoirX BYE: command.

NOTE: If The AChoirX Client looses connection with the AChoirX server, it
will retry 10 times at 60 second interals.  If no Re-connection can be 
established it will exit out.  This means that when you shut down the AChoirX
server, all remote sessions will terminate in 10 Minutes.

NOTE: This functionality is in Beta, so please provide feedback so I can improve
this new capability.

NOTE: Since AChoirX is Cross-Platform (Windows, Linux, OSX), both the Client and
Server modes will work on all three platforms.


A note about Conditonal Logic 
(CKY:, 64B:, 32B:, CKN:, RC=:, RC!:, RC>:, RC<:, END:, LBL:, JMP:, VER:)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conditional Logic doesn't make much sense in Interactive Mode (/CON), but you may want to know 
these various conditions.  AChoirX is coded to give the results of these comparisons in 
Interactive Mode, and to take Conditional Action in regular Scripted Mode.  In Interactive Mode
AChoirX WILL NOT take conditional action.


A note about Syslogging
-----------------------
By default Syslogging is turned OFF - This is in keeping with my desire to keep the AChoirX
footprint minimal, and have as little impact on the target machine as possible.  In some cases
however, the need run and track AChoirX across many machines overides the above.

To turn Syslogging on, simply set the Syslog Server IP (SET:SyslogS=nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn). AChoirX 
is currently written to have three logging levels (none, min, max). The Syslog Protocol Type 
can also be set (UDP or TCP).


A note about Case Information (/CSE, CSE:GET, CSE:SAY)
------------------------------------------------------
To avoid any accidental confusion about Case information (that may jeopardize non-repudiation),
I have coded AChoirX to disallow changing Case information after it has been displayed. Some may
find this draconian, but it is important to avoid ambiguity when doing forensic analysis, so 
I have chosen to disallow changing Case information even if the default settings are displayed.

Also Note: Case Information is entirely optional - You can use AChoirX without entering any 
           Case Information, and this is the default (so AChoirX can run fully unattended)


A note about EXE: EXA:
----------------------
Under normal circumstances I recommend using EXE: to execute programs, it is much easier to 
control the script when things are run sequentially, but in cases where there may be several 
machines running AChoir, or Execution Time is limited or important, one may want to run 
several programs Concurrently or in the Background.  The primary problem with this method 
is that one cannot know when these Asynchoronously run programs will complete. 

Use EXA: judiciously, bearing in mind that NOT ONLY will they complete at different times, 
but the AChoirX Script ITSELF will continue to run as these programs also run in parrallel.  
In fact, AChoirX could even complete and exit while these programs are still executing.  
This can have major implications for your AChoirX scripts. 


A note about System32 File ReDirection:
---------------------------------------
When Non-Native programs (for instance 32 bit programs on 64 Bit Windows) are run, the 
Operating System will redirect files located in the %SystemRoot%\System32 directory to 
a different directory.  This directory can be different based on circumstances, but its
alias is always %SystemRoot%\Sysnative.  I am slowly building this into all the parts 
of AChoirX.  This can be seen in the CPY: Copy function and the FOR: function.

AchoirX will try to detect if it is not running Native, and will adjust some of it's 
actions based on that.  Whenever AChoirX does this, it will note it on the screen and
in the Acquisition Log.

One may wonder - why not just use whatever Windows tells us.  The answer to that is 
simple: If we are running AChoirX on an endpoint, we may be interested in BOTH the 
32Bit artifacts AND the 64Bit artifacts.  Since BOTH can be present, and BOTH may 
be relevant to an investigation, AChoirX will always try to get both artifacts if 
it can.


A note about Encryption (/DEC:, ENC: and DEC:):
------------------------------------------------
As of Beta v10.00.29 - AChoirX has it's own built-in Encryption.  The Password used to
encrypt or decrypt files is set via the /PWD: or PWD: options.

Important Note: The /DEC: option the output file will always decrypt to a file called 
                "Decrypted.Dat".  However, when using the DEC: or ENC: commands in AChoirX 
                scripts, both the input file name and output file name can be specified.

Encryption adds a powerful new set of capabilities when coupled with other AChoirX options.
For instance, the /GET: command line option can be used with /PWD: and /DEC: to download an
encrypted Script, and then decrypt it and run it.  This especially important if you are 
using UserIds, Passwords, Tokens, or other Access Keys in your scripts.  This allows the 
scripts and/or supporting files to be encrypted to help limit the risk of accidental 
disclosure.


A note about /GET:
------------------
The /GET: Option will get a file using HTTP or HTTPS.  This is a way to get a file from 
a Web Server that will be used in the acquisition.  This can be used in a multitude of 
ways - but the most obvious is to host an AChoirX Script on a Web Server, download it 
and run it.  

This would look like:
AChoirX /get:http://192.168.1.1/Test1.txt /ini:Test1.txt


A note about S3 Upload (S3S:, S3U:)
-----------------------------------
AChoirX supports direct upload to an S3 Bucket.  This can be extremely beneficial when 
creating a way to collect artifacts and telemetry from remote machines, or to do a 
large number of collections from many machines into one central place.

The functions and variables for doing S3 Uploads are:
* S3S:<local File Name> <Remote S3 Bucket File Name>
* S3U:<AWS ID> <AWS Secret Key>
* SET:S3Region=<AWS Region>
* SET:S3Bucket=<AWS Bucket>
* SET:S3AWSId=<AWS ID>
* SET:S3AWSKey=<AWS Key>

The recommended way to do S3 Uploads is to set the 4 parameters, and call the S3U: action.
This will automatically start an AWS S3 Session and do the S3 Bucket Upload.  If for some 
reason you want to control the creation of the AWS Session, you can start a session directly 
using the S3S: action.  Either method works equally well.


A note about SFTP Upload (SFS:, SFU:)
-------------------------------------
AChoirX supports direct upload to an SFTP Server.  This can be extremely beneficial when 
creating a way to collect artifacts and telemetry from remote machines, or to do a 
large number of collections from many machines into one central place.

The functions and variables for doing SFTP Uploads are:
* SET:SFTPServ=<SFTPServer>
* SFS: <UserId> <Password>
* SFU: <Local Fname> <Remote FName>

The recommended way to do SFTP Uploads is to set the SFTPServ parameter, call the SFS:
action, and then call the SFU: action.


A note about Wildcards (FOR:, CPY:, S3U:, SFU:)
-----------------------------------------------
In order to allow both current directory searches and current+subdirectory searches
I have come up with the following nomenclature (Note: this is a change from AChoir):

* If a Star Wildcard (*) is present (for instance FOR:.\*\files.*) AChoirX will search 
  the wildcarded directory.  Multiple subdirectories can be controlled by adding 
  wildcards such as: .\*\*\files.*
* If a Double Star (**) is present (for instance FOR:.\**\files.*) AChoirX will search 
  all subdirectories regardless of depth.


A note about Embedded Files
---------------------------
AChoirX for Windows, Linux, and OSX now have embedded zip files.  If a Toolkit is not present, 
AChoirX will unzip these files to create a very basic Toolkit.  This allows a basic version of
AChoirX to run with only the single AChoirX executable file.


A note about UniCode
--------------------
AchoirX is written in Go and defaults to UTF-8. However, many of the utilities that 
AChoirX uses, will write UniCode (i.e. UTF-16) text output files.  In order for AChoirX to 
be able read and parse that output, it needs to convert any UniCode to UTF-8. To make 
that possible, AChoirX will ignore all =x'00' in a string. AChoirX will internally convert 
UTF-16 input to UTF-8 and write all its output as UTF-8. 


A note about Filtering
----------------------
AchoirX has a "Filtering" Option.  This can be used in many cases to LIMIT the &FOR and 
&LST entries.  There are many use cases for this type of option. To make filtering as 
easy as possible I have made it global across BOTH &LST and &FOR objects.  To set the 
File to be used for filtering use the FLT:<filename> or NONE command. The Filter File
contains text entries to FILTER both the &FOR and &LST objects.  Setting the file name 
is not enough to filter, the SET:FILTER= options MUST also be set. This includes the 
following options: SET:FILTER=<incl> <excl> <full> <part>
- incl = &FOR or &LST match entries in Filter File 
- excl = &FOR or &LST does NOT match entries in Filter File 
- full = &FOR or &LST Exact match with entries in Filter File 
- part = &FOR or &LST Partial match with entries in Filter File 
- regx = &FOR or &LST Regex match with entries in Filter File 

The NONE option removes the filter.  Warning: The FILTER IS USED FOR BOTH &LST and &FOR.  
Set FLT:NONE when the filter is no longer needed to avoid unwanted filtering.


Artifacts that AChoirX itself generates:
----------------------------------------
AchoirX itself will generate a few files.  These are meant to increase non-repudiation
and make the artifacts easier to use.

Embedded ToolKit Files
-----------------------
AChoirX for Windows, Linux, and OSX now have embedded zip files.  If a Toolkit is not present, 
AChoirX will unzip these files to create a very basic Toolkit.  This allows a basic version of
AChoirX to run with only the single AChoirX executable file.

Logfile (ACQ-IR-<name>-<date>-<time>.txt
----------------------------------------
AchoirX will create a logfile for each acquisition in the /Logs directory. The log contains 
both the actions taken by AChoirX and additional information such as the hash of each program 
that is run.

DirHash.txt
-----------
When requested in the AChoirX Script (HSH:DIR), AChoirX will hash all files starting at the 
directory AChoirX is run from (AChoirX's root directory) and store the MD5 hashes in this file.

ACQHash.txt
-----------
When requested in the AChoirX Script (HSH:ACQ), AchoirX will hash all acquired artifacts and 
store the MD5 hashes in this file.

Index.htm
---------
AchoirX will generate an Index.htm file for every acquisition.  This file can be opened with 
your favorite web browser to browse and open the acquired artifacts.  This is an incredibly 
simple but useful feature.  

ForFiles
---------
AChoirX will create a temporary file in the Acquisition Cache Directory called "ForFiles"
every time the FOR: Action is used.  ForFiles contains the results and is used when the 
&FOR Looping object (variable) is used.

ForDisks
---------
AChoirX will create a temporary file in the Acquisition Cache Directory called "ForDisks"
every time the DSK: Action is used.  ForDisks contains the results and is used when the 
&DSK Looping object (variable) is used. Note: This function is only relevant for Windows.



Last Thoughts:
--------------
The AChoirX language is pretty simple.  And I will do my best to keep it that way.  To best 
understand it, please take a look at the Build.ACQ and Achoir.ACQ scripts
